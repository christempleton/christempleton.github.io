My research interests and projects are diverse, but the common themes relate to understanding how organisms obtain, communicate, and use information in their environments. Some of the recent research projects in my lab are described below. This sonogram shows one duet song type from a pair of Happy Wrens, with each sex's contribution color coded. Click here to hear an audio recording of this song. Social learning and avian cognition How do social factors affect how animals learn about new food sources or select vocalizations to include in their repertoires? How do social networks affect the spread of information through groups of animals? Does vocal learning predict other types of learning abilities? Avian vocal learning Songbirds are one of the few taxa that learn their vocalizations and the vocal learning process bears remarkable similarities to human language learning. One parallel that we are particularly interested in is the strong effects of social interactions for shaping vocal learning. We use lab experiments, field observations, and field experiments to explore the nature of vocal learning process, from hormonal to social and ecological processes. Function and evolution of anti-predator signals Predation is ubiquitous and is one of the most important selective pressures acting on animals. Many birds produce alarm calls to communicate about predators. What type of information is transmitted through these calls? Our work with Black-capped Chickadees ( Poecile atricapillus ), demonstrated one of the most sophisticated anti-predator communication systems yet discovered. We also showed that other species eavesdrop on these vocalizations and discriminate among subtle variations when making behavioral decisions. Recent research has focused on understanding the evolution of mobbing in chickadees and tits, how information about predators spreads through ecological communities, and how young birds learn their anti-predator vocalizations. Ontogeny and function of vocal duetting Pairs of neotropical wrens sing some of the most impressive coordinated duets of any animal but why do some birds sing complex duets when solo songs from one sex suit other species just fine? How do they learn to sing when not just the male, but both sexes must learn their songs? How do birds coordinate their song duets? I am currently exploring these questions in neotropical wrens in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.","tags":"","url":"research_old.html","UUID":"4E62A56A91574E849198433D3C5AE351"},{"title":"Templeton Lab Research","text":" Research Our research examines the evolutionary and ecological implications of animal behavior.

We study the behavior, cognition, learning, and ecology of animal communication, often focusing on birds. This sonogram shows a duet from a pair of Happy Wrens, with each sex's contribution color coded. Impact of noise on communication and cognition Humans create an incredible amount of noise. How do these noises affect the way in which animals behave and communicate? We study how the acoustic properties of noise reduce information transfer within and between species through acoustically masking. We are also investigating how noise pollution affects the way animals learn to solve new challenges, both individually and socially from other birds, and ultimately how noise impacts animal populations. Anti-predator communication Many birds produce alarm calls to communicate about predators. What type of information is transmitted through these signals? Our work with black-capped chickadees ( Poecile atricapillus ) demonstrated a surprisingly sophisticated communication system in which alarm calls designate predator threat levels. We have continued studying alarm calls to better understand the evolution of information encoding strategies in different songbird species, how young birds learn to recognize and communicate about predators, and how eavesdropping creates vast information networks across communities of animals.

Students will compare the biodiversity, adaptations, and natural history of species in the Galápagos Islands and the Andes cloud forest in mainland Ecuador. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the history and culture of Ecuador, and study the unique features of the Galápagos Islands where Darwin developed his ideas on the origin of species. Evaluation will be based on participation, discussions, presentations, and completion of a field notebook. Fall prep: time TBA. January travel to Ecuador. Course syllabus Animal Communication (Biol 435) The world is full of sights, sounds, and smells—many of which are produced by animals. But what do these conspicuous signals mean? In this course, we will provide a general overview of the how, when, where, and why of animal signals as we search for general principles underlying the biology of animal communication. The course begins with an examination of the mechanisms by which animals produce and perceive signals and covers all of the basic modalities (sight, sound, touch, and smell). The second part of the course then examines the evolution of different types of signals and how they are used to communicate information. The approach we will take in this course will be broad, considering the evolution of animal communication by drawing from a broad range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, physiology, ecology, psychology, economics, music, language, and of course animal behavior. Investigative laboratory and field experiences are integrated into the course to provide practical hands-on experiences studying animal communication. MWF 1-2:05pm, Th 8-11am lab. Course syllabus I t is hard to study animal learning and not gain a deep appreciation for our own species' exceptional learning and teaching abilities. Teaching provides constant opportunities to better understand the process of learning and my own teaching strategies continually evolve as we discover more about how people learn. At Pacific, I teach a variety of courses throughout the Biology curriculum. In my courses, I strive to inspire curiosity about nature, develop critical thinking skills, and promote life-long learning in my students through both the content I teach and the processes I use in the classroom. Advanced Research Methods (Biol 489) This course provides experience in designing biological research questions using primary literature, performing experiments, drawing conclusions from data, and communicating scientific results. Students will work collaboratively to investigate original research questions using a combination of field, laboratory, and analytical approaches. This semester, our efforts will focus on the fields of animal communication and cognition as students collaboratively design and conduct novel research in these fields. 4 credits. MW 2:15-5:15pm.

We learn how information is coded (the \"languages\" of life) and follow how types of information flow across different levels of organization from molecular and cellular levels to organismal and population levels. We also integrate across these levels of biological organization and study the evolutionary changes in information that occur over time. Course syllabus Natural History of the Galapagos and Ecuador (Biol 165\/365) This travel course is a unique opportunity for Pacific students to explore and study in one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world. Students will compare the biodiversity, adaptations, and natural history of species in the Galápagos Islands and the Andes cloud forest in mainland Ecuador. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the history and culture of Ecuador, and study the unique features of the Galápagos Islands where Darwin developed his ideas on the origin of species. Evaluation will be based on participation, discussions, presentations, and completion of a field notebook. Fall prep: Thursday 4:30-6pm. January travel to Ecuador.

Come visit us in Forest Grove, Oregon. If you’re a student at Pacific and want to get involved with behavioral research, come talk to me! June 2015: Nora and Chris attend the Animal Behavior Society annual meetings in Anchorage. Here’s a picture of Nora’s talk. Other conference highlights included glaciers, whales, otters, and puffins! (and there was some science too). Check out this selfie of Chris together with two of his most important mentors. April 2015: New popular science article co-written by Nora and Chris appears in Biosphere Magazine. October 2014: Public outreach in the form of stand up comedy: Nora, \"the headless bird girl\" discusses her work on tits at a Bright Club event, with much laughter, and hopefully, quiet a bit of knowledge exchange too! Watch the full video of her hilarious set here June 2014: Congratulations to Esmeralda Quiros-Guerrera on her CONACYT fellowship. Esme will be starting a PhD with us this autumn focusing on wren duets. Well done! New paper on problem solving and song published in Animal Behaviour with colleagues Neeltje Boogert and Kevin Laland. November 2013: Taxidermy! Chris and Nora spend two days in Edinburgh constructing raptor mounts with master taxidermist George Jamieson. Get ready tits, here we come! more pictures here October 2013: Duet coordination paper Our newest paper on happy wren duet coordination was published in Animal Behaviour (see publications for the pdf). Here are links to some of the popular press coverage. August 2013: New Lab Member Welcome incoming PhD student, Nora Carlson ! Nora has just arrived in St Andrews from the US and she will investigate avian alarm call signal function and learning in Parids for her thesis research. Jan 2013: Interested in joining the lab? PhD studentships are potentially available at the University of St Andrews for enthusiastic and motivated young scientists interested in animal communication. Possible projects could investigate alarm signaling in Parids or chorusing in wrens. For more information about these two research projects, follow these links: ALAR wren choruses If you’re interested in either position, please send me an email describing your research interests and past experiences and we can discuss further. Closing date for applications is 31 January 2013. Nov 2012: Our newest paper on happy wren duets was just published online in Biology Letters with associated coverage in the popular media. Here are a couple of the stories. Summer Research is underway. Three Pacific students are starting to conduct research on avian communication this summer. Welcome to the lab, Passina, Lauren, and Ari! May 2017: Nora gets hooded! A big congrats to Nora, who has earned her PhD at St Andrews. Here she is showing off her new threads with collaborator Lauren Guillette. March 2016: Congrats to Nora who has published her first academic paper! Its a big one that took a massive amount of work. Check it out in Animal Behaviour this month. June 2017: Chris and recent Pacific graduate Emily Geddes attend Animal Behavior Society annual meeting in Toronto. Kudos to Emily for presenting her undergraudate capstone project as a poster! December 2016: New paper out in Current Biology in collaboration with Sue Anne Zollinger and Henrik Brumm from the Max Planck Institute. showing that traffic noise affects both production and perception of great tit alarm calls. Among other press, Chris was interviewed on BBC's evening news program the Newsroom . July 2016: Chris travels back to the UK to present a paper at the ISBE conference in Exeter. November 2017: Lauren wins best poster award at the annual Murdock college science research conference! July 2017: Fieldwork under way at Fern Hill Wetlands and in Costa Rica.

We study the behavior, cognition, and ecology of animal communication, mostly in birds. the Templeton Lab We study the behavior, cognition, and ecology of animal communication, especially in birds Welcome to Chris Templeton's lab at Pacific University Lab News August 2015: BIG News: Chris has moved to Pacific University ! Come visit us in Forest Grove, Oregon. If you’re a student at Pacific and want to get involved with behavioral research, come talk to me! June 2015: Nora and Chris attend the Animal Behavior Society annual meetings in Anchorage. Here’s a picture of Nora’s talk. Other conference highlights included glaciers, whales, otters, and puffins! (and there was some science too). Check out this selfie of Chris together with two of his most important mentors. April 2015: New popular science article co-written by Nora and Chris appears in Biosphere Magazine. October 2014: Public outreach in the form of stand up comedy: Nora, \"the headless bird girl\" discusses her work on tits at a Bright Club event, with much laughter, and hopefully, quiet a bit of knowledge exchange too! Watch the full video of her hilarious set here June 2014: Congratulations to Esmeralda Quiros-Guerrera on her CONACYT fellowship. Esme will be starting a PhD with us this autumn focusing on wren duets. Well done! New paper on problem solving and song published in Animal Behaviour with colleagues Neeltje Boogert and Kevin Laland. November 2013: Taxidermy! Chris and Nora spend two days in Edinburgh constructing raptor mounts with master taxidermist George Jamieson. Get ready tits, here we come! more pictures here October 2013: Duet coordination paper Our newest paper on happy wren duet coordination was published in Animal Behaviour (see publications for the pdf). Here are links to some of the popular press coverage. August 2013: New Lab Member Welcome incoming PhD student, Nora Carlson ! Nora has just arrived in St Andrews from the US and she will investigate avian alarm call signal function and learning in Parids for her thesis research. Jan 2013: Interested in joining the lab? PhD studentships are potentially available at the University of St Andrews for enthusiastic and motivated young scientists interested in animal communication. Possible projects could investigate alarm signaling in Parids or chorusing in wrens. For more information about these two research projects, follow these links: ALAR wren choruses If you’re interested in either position, please send me an email describing your research interests and past experiences and we can discuss further. Closing date for applications is 31 January 2013. Nov 2012: Our newest paper on happy wren duets was just published online in Biology Letters with associated coverage in the popular media. Here are a couple of the stories. June 2017: Summer Research is underway. Three Pacific students are starting to conduct research on avian communication this summer. Welcome to the lab, Passina, Lauren, and Ari! May 2017: Nora gets hooded! A big congrats to my first PhD Nora, who very much earned her PhD at St Andrews with her excellent thesis on anti-predator communication in flocks of tits. Here she is showing off her new threads with collaborator Lauren Guillette. March 2016: Congrats to Nora who has published her first academic paper! Its a big one that took a massive amount of work. Check it out in Animal Behaviour this month. June 2017: Chris and recent Pacific graduate Emily Geddes attend Animal Behavior Society annual meeting in Toronto. Kudos to Emily for presenting her undergraudate capstone project as a poster! December 2016: New paper out in Current Biology in collaboration with Sue Anne Zollinger and Henrik Brumm from the Max Planck Institute, showing that traffic noise affects both production and perception of great tit alarm calls. Among other press, Chris was interviewed on BBC's evening news program the Newsroom (for some strange reason they decided that John Kerry was more important to put on the image than a flock of tits) July 2016: Chris travels back to the UK to present a paper at the ISBE conference in Exeter. October 2017: Esmeralda's first paper from her PhD published in Ethology --congrats Esme! July 2017: Fieldwork under way at Fern Hill Wetlands and in Costa Rica. Check out Lauren's blog about her adventures wrangling wrens on the Osa Peninsula. January 2018: Chris is teaching a travel course in the Galapagos and Ecuador. Darwin's finches and boobies, here I come. April 2018: Excellent talks given by the three seniors in the lab today at the Pacific Senior Projects Day symposium. Congrats to Passina, Ari, and Lauren! March 2018: Nearly 10 years in the making, we've finally published the first paper examining the ontogeny of duetting rules in wrens--congrats to Karla Rivera-Caceres on her newest paper in Royal Society Open Science . Some nice press coverage of the paper, especially this podcast from Scientific American featuring excellent wren imitations by Karla. March 2018: Grant Success: thanks to the Murdock Trust , we'll be studying communication in neotropical wrens for the next few years. May 2018: A big congrats to Passina, who was honored with this year's top graduating senior award by the biology department!","summary":"Chris Templeton’s lab homepage at Pacific University.

Teaching provides constant opportunities to better understand the process of learning and in turn my own teaching strategies continually evolve as we discover more about how people learn.   Educating students is deeply integrated into my scientific career and I strive to inspire curiosity about nature, develop critical thinking skills, and promote life-long learning in my students. As a teacher, I aim to cultivate these abilities through both the content I teach and the processes I use in my classroom.
